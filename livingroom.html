On this page you will find aesthetically pleasing storage options for keeping your living room unblemished and unsullied.</p>

      <p> I reccomend that before considering my storage solutions, you first take into account your own needs and special circumstances in this order: </p>
        
        <ol>
    <li>How much space do I have?</li>
    <li>How many people live in my home?</li>
        <li>Is the arragement of my furniture currently suiting our needs? Would another arrangement be better?</li>
        <li>Am I using all of my current stoarge space efficiently?</li>
        <li>Is there a certain group of objects that seem to need more or better storage?</li>
            </ol>

            Do you have teeny tadpoles running around? Or even perhaps a special slimy friend, like my dear pet snail, Ginger? Pictured here is one of my most favorite options to hide all of those little toys that us frivolous frogs love to hoard for our honey-sweet honeys.

            If you are anything like me, you might have an abundance of quirky knicknacks that you're just dying to display. The China Cabinet is an opportune option for this, because not only is it a grand piece of furniture, but it's that perfect place for all your tiny tchotchkes that go nowhere else! A burly bonus is all of that storage underneath too! (<u>Note.</u> This image was generated by Google Gemini from the prompt vintage china cabinet in a fancy pink and green living room.)

            The bigger the credenza, the better. While they ultimately provide a marvelous focal point for the room, credenzas are inconspicuously incredible at hiding clutter. You can put anything in here from your dvd collection, your old diaries, photoalbums, playing cards, candle sticks, linens, or lutes.

            Shelves are a frog's best friend. Here you can put books, pictures, special treasures, art, anything your froggy heart desires. Baskets can be put here too to hide some of the more unsightly materials. While sparsely filled shelves may seem more aesthetic, don't be afraid to go completely maximalist. Your house guests will never run out of stuff to look at and question you about!
