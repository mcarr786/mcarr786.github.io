        <p>The Kitchen can either be one of the most relaxing places in your home, or the most chaotic. A relaxing kitchen is neatly organized; each algae and antworm is in its place, each toadstool and tea cup perfectly aligned. A stressful chaotic kitchen has stuff everywhere, with no ideal order, strange stains, and stinky smells. Follow these tips for a stunningly organized kitchen!</p>
        
        
        <p>The heart and soul of the kitchen is your food, so great place to start organizing is in the pantry. I reccomend organizing your food in on the following cateogies:

            Sometimes you need bigger containers to house all of your ingredients, and sometimes you're just tired of looking at the Killeg logo everywhere! Mason jars are the answer: airtight containers that can hold pretty much anything, and make for a delightful display.

            Dishes are difficult. There are so many of them and so many different sizes of them! These exposed cabinets are great for those dishes that are a little different and a little large. Save those plain and uniformly sized dishes for the cabinets underneath!
